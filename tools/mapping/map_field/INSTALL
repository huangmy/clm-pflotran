HOW TO BUILD
============

Prior to building, you must make sure $CCSMROOT is set.

$ cd src
$ $CCSMROOT/scripts/ccsm_utils/Machines/configure -mach [machine name]
$ gmake

Note: in the second step, replace [machine name] with the machine you are
building on. Also, some machines (such as janus) have dedicated build nodes,
so you might need to SSH to another node before the 'gmake' step.

==================================
COMMON BUILD / RUN ISSUES ON JANUS
==================================

1) As hinted at in the "How to Build" section, you can not build on the login
  nodes on janus. If you see the error

  ld: cannot find -lrdmacm
  ld: cannot find -libverbs

  you are still on the headnode and need to SSH to node0001.

2) At present, the netCDF libraries available on janus have all been built
   with mpif90, which means that everything linking with netCDF must also
   be built in parallel. Unfortunately, this means you can not run map_fields
   from the head node -- you either need to push it through the queue or just
   run it from node0001. Running on node0001 is easier, but to run from the
   queue, edit map_field.janus.run (both the header info to set the requested
   walltime and the body of the script to point to the correct mapping file and
   name the domain files appropriately), and then run

   qsub map_field.janus.run
